Enigma crypto transmission from KPH coastal radio station
---------------------------------------------------------

On 2025-08-30 at 20:00 UTC, radio station [KPH](https://www.radiomarine.org) on the coast of Northern California transmitted an [Enigma](https://cipherhistory.com)-encoded radio transmission; a fragment related to <details><summary>(spoilers!)</summary>[Operation Sea Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion)</details>.

I attempted to capture and decrypt the transmission; this was my second time participating in one of these cryptography-related events hosted by the MRHS.

This repository documents the process that I followed, and the results.
